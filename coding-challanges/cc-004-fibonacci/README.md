# Coding Challenge - 006: Fibonacci

The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program in bash script that prints Fibonacci series as long as the input provided by the user.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify, and apply programming knowledge for an appropriate solution.

- Implement conditional statements effectively to solve a problem.

- Implement loops to solve a problem.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by solving the problem effectively.

## Problem Statement

Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonacci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …)

- Expected Output 1:

```text
How many fibonacci numbers would you like to generate? 5
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
How many fibonacci numbers would you like to generate? 10
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
How many fibonacci numbers would you like to generate? 1
[1]
```
